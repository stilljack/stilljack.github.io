                     <p>10/20/2019<br> What do people want? send me an e-mail stilljack@gmail.com
<br>
send me the idea, i'll learn how to make it if i think it will make me some money to feed my son.<br><br>Why am I completely blank when I think: "what software would I want?"

                 <p>I dunno something about some syntactic sugar or whatever
<br><br>
        I really want to stay along the ol' lambda path because as bumpy as it's been, if nothing else it's been invaluable in keeping me focused
                          and accountable. I like when I have to do stuff because otherwise some hierachal structure will get real cross with me.<br><br>I need a project, I think if I could figure out something I truly cared about that I could do with software I'd... well I'd never look up again. Until the body broke down I'd just chase that project unrelentingly (what for as to avoid per·il·ous moments of self reflection)

                 <p>here's a quote I found funny today:
<br><br>
<i>
"Before kicking off Feedback Friday, we wanted to share that Business Insider (a blog) may run a possibly negative piece on Lambda School. We’ve been open to the reporter’s questions and addressed inaccuracies, but for privacy reasons we don't speak publicly about specific student experiences or situations.
                 </i>
                 <br>
                         You know (a blog) like,<br>
                         Amazon (an online retailer)<br>
                         China (a country)<br>
                         The Washington Post (lying liberal rag)<br><br>Ahhh this is a goof. I got a chance this week to play with very simple algorithms for drawing lines and circles and such and i thought maybe I could do some more very primative work and see if anything came of it.<br>Maybe....
                 
                 
        <p>10/09/2019<br>
        This is a fight that the good guys might actually be able to win....
<br><p>
Over the last couple days a situation has developed around a professional level player of Blizzard's mega-hit internet based collectible card game Hearthstone. Chung “Blitzchung” Ng Wai, during the broadcast of an in real life hearthstone event voiced support for Hong Kong protesters (which incidentally is a vote for the most core of American values: Liberty.) -- he was promptly banned from hearthstone for the length or a year and had recent tournament winnings stripped from him. Worse still, in blizzards cowardice, they also fired the two streamer personalities who were interviewing Ng Wai despite their own cowardice in, quote, "physically ducking [away] from Ng Wai"
        <br><p>
It is not at all hard to understand this choice on blizzards part. If China feels blizzard is not doing their part to prevent dissident speech, China will not hesitate to completely block Hearthstone within China's borders. While this makes sense economically, it is obviously a vile, pathetic and cynical choice. You would be hard pressed to find anyone in this world outside of the PRC --and even then, outside of the communist party -- who would think this was a just and good stance for blizzard to take.
        <br><p>
So why does this matter? This is a fight the good guys could potentially win and one that will have an impact on other companies in america and the west. If blizzard can be shown that we will stop using their products if they actively do harm to our core value of Liberty: it is possible they will back down, reinstate Ng Wai and the streamers and accept that its better to lose the Chinese market than the entire western world. If on the other hand the boycott doesn't move forward we will keep seeing this sort of horrible behavior from american companies and soon, China will actively be able to enforce its draconian anti-speech laws beyond its borders; and we will all watch our tongues about the PRC.
        <br><p>
Boycott blizzard, perhaps more importantly -- spread around to anyone you can what has happened here. We can't let liberty die, now's the chance to fight this fight before this kind of behavior starts spreading and we begin to see Xi's influence engulf the west.
        <br><p>
Tell everyone.

        Hmm making progress -- feels like it's been a bit unenthusiastic a week, no grand leaps -- just unit testing and techniques in that domain.
spek is very cool and I could absolutely see writing test in it, the installation is a little much but it's doable and the rewards are groovy.<br><br>

Reactive programming holds some siren like appeal to me. I'm not sure where to go with this but it's fascinating.<br><br>

Room is magic. Android jetpack has yet to let me down, mostly thats worked the other way.<br>
      I'm sort of low energy today, but its actually been really productive.<br>
      Google is the closest thing to God in my life.

Nothing interesting to report.<br>
Build week is next week, should be fun.

 The tao is probably the interface not the class implementing the interface<br>
 I don't think that actually means anything.<br>
 <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/io/FileReader">FileReader</a> feels snappier than I expected.

 SharedPreferences<br>
 SharedPrefs are wild insecure and seem to really be best employed only for the most trivial of saved data. KeyStore seems interesting as an alternative
  that can provide at least some protection of user data and perhaps a place to store anything of more value than darktheme/False(<a href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore">https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore</a>)<br>
  The better the model, the easier it will be to code for, everything comes out of the model.
