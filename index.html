 SharedPreferences<br>
 SharedPrefs are wild insecure and seem to really be best employed only for the most trivial of saved data. KeyStore seems interesting as an alternative
  that can provide at least some protection of user data and perhaps a place to store anything of more value than darktheme/False(<a href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore">https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore</a>)<br>
  The better the model, the easier it will be to code for, everything comes out of the model.
